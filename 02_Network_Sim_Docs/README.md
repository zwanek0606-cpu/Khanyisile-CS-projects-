# Secure LAN Configuration & Verification
## 🌐 Focus: Networking Fundamentals (Cisco Packet Tracer)

### Overview
This project simulates a small business network (LAN) setup, focusing on proper device configuration and IP addressing using the Cisco Packet Tracer CLI. 
### Key Skills Demonstrated
-   **Device Configuration:** Practical application of **Cisco IOS CLI commands** to configure the Router (default gateway).
-   **IP Addressing:** Assigned static IPs to the Router and Server, and configured the Server to provide **DHCP** services to the client PCs.
-   **Connectivity Verification:** Used the `ping` command to verify end-to-end communication between all devices, proving a stable Layer 3 connection.
