# Secure Cloud VPC Architecture Design
## 🔒 Focus: Cloud Security Principles & Network Segmentation

### Overview
This project outlines a best-practice architecture for deploying a secure web application in a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** environment, focusing on minimizing the attack surface.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
-   **Network Segmentation:** Clearly defined the roles and boundaries of **Public Subnets** (hosting web servers) and **Private Subnets** (hosting sensitive database servers).
-   **Defense-in-Depth:** Ensured the database is completely isolated from direct internet access, only allowing traffic from the internal web servers (layered security).
-   **Security Best Practice:** A design choice that confirms theoretical understanding of modern cloud security principles.
